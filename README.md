- **Perfect circular coverage** with radius-based positioning
- **Paint-while-dragging** functionality for continuous painting
- **Visual preview** with circular outline and cell highlights

### 🌿 **Spray Paint Tools** - Natural Terrain Variation
- **Light Spray Paint (5%)**: Ultra-sparse coverage for subtle terrain hints
- **Medium Spray Paint (10%)**: Medium sparse coverage for natural terrain mixing  
- **Heavy Spray Paint (20%)**: Dense coverage for strong terrain variation
- **Randomized application** creates realistic, organic terrain patterns
- **All radius sizes supported**: Single cell through radius 32 for each intensity level

### 🌅 **Edge Blender Tools** - Intelligent Terrain Transitions
- **Smart boundary detection** automatically finds terrain edges
- **Three blend strengths**: Light (10%), Medium (30%), Heavy (60%)
- **Multiple radius options**: 1, 2, 4, and 8 for different transition sizes
- **Contextual blending** creates smooth, natural terrain transitions

### 📏 **Line Tools** - Precision Terrain Drawing
- **Two-click interface**: Set start point, then end point to draw straight lines
- **All terrain types** supported with dedicated menu per terrain
- **Perfect straight lines** using Bresenham line algorithm
- **Visual preview** shows line path before confirming

### ⬜ **Rectangle Tools** - Geometric Terrain Areas
- **Filled Rectangles**: Complete area coverage for rooms, courtyards, and foundations
- **Border-Only Rectangles**: Perimeter-only coverage for walls, fences, and outlines
- **Two-click interface**: Set opposite corners to define rectangle area
- **Visual preview** distinguishes between filled and border modes
- **All terrain types** supported for both filled and border variants

### 🪣 **Fill Tools** - Flood Fill Connected Areas
- **Smart flood fill** changes all connected cells of the same terrain type
- **Performance limited** to 10,000 cells to prevent lag
- **Preview system** shows affected areas under 500 cells
- **All terrain types** supported for complete area transformation

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Enable Development Mode** in RimWorld options
2. **Open Debug Menu** (F12 or debug icon)
3. **Search for "Terrain Painter"** in the actions list
4. **Choose your tool type** from the hierarchical menu

### Using Brush and Spray Tools
1. Navigate to **Brushes** or any **Spray Paint** category
2. **Select brush radius** (Single cell to Radius 32)
3. **Choose terrain type** from the submenu
4. **Click and drag** on the map to paint terrain
5. **Right-click** to cancel the active tool

### Using Edge Blender Tools  
1. Navigate to **Edge Blender Tools**
2. **Select blend strength** (Light, Medium, or Heavy)
3. **Choose radius** (1, 2, 4, or 8)
4. **Click on terrain edges** to automatically blend transitions
5. The tool intelligently detects boundaries and creates smooth transitions

### Using Line Tools
1. Navigate to **Line Tools** 
2. **Select terrain type** from the menu
3. **Click first point** on the map to set line start
4. **Click second point** to set line end and draw the terrain line
5. **Right-click** to cancel before setting the second point

### Using Rectangle Tools

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Spray tools** create more natural, varied terrain than solid brushes
- **Edge blenders** work best on existing terrain boundaries for smooth transitions
- **Line tools** are perfect for roads, rivers, or geometric terrain features
- **Rectangle tools** excel at creating rooms, foundations, walls, and geometric areas
- **Fill tools** excel at replacing large uniform areas quickly
- **Combine tools** for complex terrain design (e.g., brush base terrain, spray variations, blend edges)
- **Use smaller brushes** for detail work, larger for broad coverage
- **Preview systems** help visualize changes before applying
- **Filled rectangles** are ideal for floors, courtyards, and area coverage
- **Border rectangles** are perfect for walls, fences, and outlines
