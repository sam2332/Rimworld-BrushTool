• Paint-while-dragging: Hold and drag to paint continuously
• Uses existing terrain selection UI for each brush size
• Visual brush preview under mouse cursor
• Integrated into Debug Menu under "Map" category

Usage:
1. Open the Debug Menu (Development mode required)
2. search for "Brush Tool" in the Actions/tools
3. Select desired brush size (e.g., "Terrain brush (16x16)")
4. Choose terrain type from the submenu
5. Click and drag on map to paint terrain with the brush

Each brush size opens a submenu with all available terrain types. Select the terrain you want to paint with and the brush tool will activate. You can click once to paint a single area, or click and drag to paint continuously as you move the mouse.</description>
